"Im from developingcountry, Indonesia , and for now i temporary work overseas for 3 years contract, it's a hard labor job, and stressful. Next year my contract is finish. But, during my stay here, because of job, and my social life, my depression got worse, and i envy this developed country. Why this country is so good. I can afford anything i want here. Why can't we just have equality in currency exchange? I I need to work 15-20 years in big company in jakarta(our capital city) , just to get equal amount of saving money from what i got from 3 years working here. Yes, that's right, it's saving money, not spending money. And yes, im going to be a rich person in such young age If I think about it, this society is sick, the gap of un equality beetwen developing vs developed country, or the poor vs the rich is too big right now. Sorry if i look like an evil person , but because of this,I almost wish for war to happen, or this world to end, and got reseted. So everyone can have another chance to gain equality, the poor can finally have a chance to have a better life. Because if this world order stay this way, it will eventually collapse on itself. Soon.";1
"Um hello ....well many can relate im sure. After today I’m convinced I’m a misanthrope. Kinda ironic cause here i go again trying to get support from others. I’m on my way to being a “construction specialist” really I’m just an asskisser. I’m below everyone. No one respects me because they think I’m doing better than they are when really i respect everyone even though I know 100% they’re doing a lot better than me. One more loose screw right there. I mean fuck ME, man. I mean I’m not getting paid that much. I drive a company vehicle. I work hard. Very very hard. I’m being micromanaged. I’m in charge of a lot of people and projects but as far as work...I think we kinda get in the way of trades doing the actual work. I hate this business. Im sure I’m”ADD” but nobody cares. It’s still my fault I mess up. People are like crabs in a bucket. I just told the painter to fuck off. I told an old guy in the parking lot to fuck off. Recently Ive moved states. Been 8 months. I can’t or don’t get a new state license so I can actually move forward. I work too much. My car is in need of repair. I bought a motorcycle which I can’t ride legally. I’m living in a house that isn’t mine. I’m staying in a nice place with an awesome view by myself. House sitting and paying them a decent amount of rent while the owners are outta town...that’s about to end in a few weeks. Hard to keep up. Social life is super super lacking and dull of course. . First time moving away on my own. Sucks when Everyone is telling me what to do. And I do it. There’s a lot going on. Exact words to the painter who was complaining about my handy work (since it’s not my job/not my specialty which I blatantly spelled out to them....is ironic considering my soon to be former position) the exact words were “ quite frankly......I. Don’t. Give. a. FUCK. I’m this close to ...” and I just shook my head and he understood right away. Either I was having a mental breakdown, burnt out or that he needed to shut his trap before I shoved that paintbrush where the sun don’t shine. As for the old man. I was driving with expired plates because I had to do some side work on the weekend and I couldn’t drive my work truck because it has a company logo. So I can’t even flip people off anymore! I explained this to the guy. Been working 60 hour weeks none stop. Happened to have work I couldn’t refuse right on the weekend so I had to risk going out again with this vehicle. I’ve been pissed off at retirees lately since I’ve done a lotta work for them in this nice area. I usually have respect but I get fed up with sucking up to people that act like toddlers. Once he took out his phone to take a pic of my license plate, I got out and asked if he was retired? He said ....yeah I am. And looked him in the eye and said “then fuck off! Go find something better to do.” He eventually left saying have a good day. But I’m just so fuckin DONE with people and myself and the world. I just don’t know how this is gonna go. It’s an ever narrowing tunnel. For ALL OF US. I mean To add to it, I lost/spent all my savings so far (not much but very much needed at this point 2 grand and then some) on fuckin online dating and scammers and complete incompetence/desperation on my part. So yeah. Don’t know what to do or where to go...options are “endless” but I keep thinking a giant meteor would simplify that quite nicely don’t you? Don’t expect anyone to actually read this all the way through or even give a shit. Or what I expect you to type. Hopefully someone relates or even chuckles like “yeah that’s me” I don’t care. I just gotta know someone else will read this and potentially understand than just let this sit and stew inside me. I’m just venting. So Say hello internet. I’m about to fucking lose it";1
I’ve been diagnosed severe bi polar where you no longer even get the good manias They just manifest as agitation or rage. After 32 years of fighting this shit I know there can be only one end. I’ve tried everything except DMT or psychedelics but why would that help Unless you can live in that realm for a majority of the time. I’ve always known it would never get better because there is just no way to overcome that the ROI on life is an investment no one would ever make it given the choice.;1
"After my closest friend left me in April, I have finally let go and realized how much I need to make the most of my life.";0
"I am only 15, and yet I feel my life is already over. I just have a pit and emptiness in my stomach that I don’t see going away long-term. 4 years ago, my mom killed herself, and I found the body. Safe to say, my childhood was a shit show of fear, emotional manipulation, feeling like a parent to my parent, despair, fighting etc. I live with my dad and sister now. My dad is a really nice guy, but has ZERO emotional intelligence. The other night, I was crying and screaming to him about how I wanted to kill myself and some other problems, and all he did was look at me with a blank expression and say he would call the police. He says he is worried about me, but I have never once felt emotionally conncected to him. I feel empty. My psych told me I have disorganised attachment style which Is apparently the worst. Coupled with the fact that I hate myself like poison and don’t think I deserve that to change, the future doesn’t seem very bright. On top of that, I think I got my mum’s good old depression gene. It seems my life is on a trajectory that is all too familiar. I feel as though I and floating in space, all alone, unable to connect to anyone because of what I’ve gone through. I am far more emotionally intelligent than anyone in my social circle, so while I’m always helping them, I have no one to begin to help me. Interactions are fun, but always empty. Everything is empty. I have no rules or discipline at all. Never have. Don’t care enough about myself to create it for myself. That’s my rant. Any advice?";1
"Isn’t it so horrible that, I don’t really want to die, but I also just like don’t really want to do anything at all? Like I kind of wish I could just sleep. Or maybe just like lay in bed all day. I don’t want to be lazy but at the same time I don’t want to do anything. I feel like I don’t deserve to live and Im just wasting space. Like there’s people that actually were going to be someone and do something with their life, who have just died. and i’m here wasting my life and wasting the space. I wish i could give my life to someone more meaningful.";1
"I want to die so badly, but I cant do this to them. They greeted me with smiles and joy. My mother asking if I ate anything and if I wanted breakfast. My elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how I slept. I dont want to make them suffer. If it weren't for them I would've killed myself already. They are also sick and need my help. I cant a abondon them. I'm so sick of living, but I have to live for them. I just want the suffering to end, and dying is the only way.";1
literally i always have assignments to do with no time to do them and i never have a day to just do nothing and im so sick of it. like im so behind in classes and then i’ll find out i have a project due tmrw and my sleep schedule is also so fucked rn so i wake up at like 5pm and i never have any time to do any of my work. and when i do i just end up failing exams or quizzes. i just hate this quarantine and i hate online classes and i just want it all to b over so i can have my life back.;1
"Hi, im obviously depressed and have almost killed myself countless times. Ive been living in a hotel for 2 weeks planning to kill myself here, away from anyone i know. The thing that stops me is the thought of hurting my friends. I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself. Im writing this so that my decision can become relatively real and so i am more likely to hold myself to it. Thank you for reading and i sincerely hope that everyone in this subreddit overcomes their depression, no matter how impossible or pointless it may seem. Good luck to everyone";1
"A reflection. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately. I’m in my 40s, in a middle managemnet position and am finishing up my first semester of graduate business school. I’m happily married and my husband loves me. All my needs are met financially. I’m doing well in all of these areas of life, exceeding even. But I’m also struggling deeply. I can’t sleep. I feel sick sometimes. I’m exhausted. I can’t wind down. My social life is nonexistent. I love my job. I love school. I get a high from both. But the relentless demands are killing me. It literally hurts when i try to relax. It makes me want to go be an Amish or something. Is this just life? Do I need to suck it up and be grateful for what I have? I believe all things worth having are worth working for. But I’m scared I can’t cut it. Advice is welcomed.";1
"Literally every little thing that goes wrong couses me unberarble emotional pain, everything hurts so much and there is no escape exept death. Nothing will ever change and no one will truly care. I beg to everything and everyone to get me out of the living world I cant take it anymore.";1
"I feel like today is my last day of life, my anxiety is so strong and I'm so worried about exams";1
"WELL I SURE SHOWED THEM, DIDN'T I? I'm a massive fuckup. I forget things the minute after I am told them. There's just a massive pile of fuzzy static in my head. My grammar has devolved into caveman-speak. I dunno if I blame my mental health or if I'm just stupid.";1

"The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life. ";1
"I have to go back to physical school tomorrow and I dread it. School is one of the reasons I wanted to die. I'm particularly good at maths but my memory is so awful I can't remember anything at all and that's how I score so less in exams. I'm traumatized of ever getting anything average because of the times I've been beaten by my parents or punished or have the one thing taken from that motivates me to even get up. I don't even have access to means of killing myself. I can't jump off a building because I live in a short building. Tried choking myself but I bailed out at the last second. No pills to OD on and I'm too weak mentally to slit my wrists. I'm so socially awkward, I constantly disappoint those around me and I feel terrible. It hurts. I wish I could just have a job that didn't require me to be smart. I'm not. It doesn't help that I also have ADHD and the shortest attention span. I cannot concentrate on anything. So tomorrow I go back to school and none of my notes and assignments are done and I barely know anything. Can't wait to get a complaint from my teachers and get the shit beaten out of me again. Before you say to call the cops or anything on my parents....I can't...I love them too much. I'm too mentally weak to do anything to hurt anyone. Idk why I am like this. If you read this, I'm sorry. I just needed to vent.";1
"Hi all. I am two years into my career with a new mortgage. I live out in the suburbs in a townhouse. I make $83K per year and my mortgage payment is $1,450 with $250 HOA fees and utilities.... etc. I probably should have decided on a smaller place or continued to rent. I feel like I am in over my head sometimes with the bills I need to pay. Work stress + living alone for the first time + stress on staying on top of payments. I just feel in over my head and so stressed. I still have recurring subscriptions that I have not cancelled that I am being charged monthly fees for. I just need support and I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I never learned how to budget very well growing up and I feel like I am drowning. Any tips or words of support welcomed. I just feel so alone and overwhelmed. Thank you.";1

"I feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize. As we’ve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely, I feel another trend has arisen and that’s the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions. Demand People expect you to be available at the drop of a hat, because they know you’re currently glued to your phone. Hyperbole aside, I make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me. For work, for emergencies, it doesn’t stray from my side. That doesn’t mean I owe anyone an immediate answer. Distance You can type things you wouldn’t dare say out loud. (Like what I just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response.) Because you can’t see the persons face, you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have. Curating Interactions Because it’s not instant, you have time to craft your response. That means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response. While this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond, it actually means people have time to manipulate answers. Intentional “On Read” There can be an effect to silence. Sometimes silence speaks. Think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that lets you know someone is thinking... When we can use the screens between us to ignore someone, to be silent, sometimes that’s louder than outright hostility. Concluding my list as I write this at 00 38, I was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep. No luck. The contemplation woke me up and for fear of losing my train of thought, I immediately reached for my phone. Now I’ve extended this late night indefinitely as I labor over this post and begin yet another highly curated interaction between strangers using screens. Who’s with me? nerd_face ";0

"I have lost who I considered my best friend. She told me that she never really cared about me and that she didn't care about losing me. Whenever I tried to spend time with her she made excuses to me and recently I have learned that it was all lies. She knew that she was the only person I trusted and she knows everything about me, and yet she hasn't minded seeing me hurt. I don't know if I can trust someone again.

"I (16M) don't understand if I am just feeling extremely anxious or am I depressed. It's not like I am getting suicidal thoughts or something. I am just not feeling okay(?) I have no Idea how to describe it but I am getting that ""feeling"" in my gut/chest. You know, the one you get when you receive some upsetting news. It has been fairly constant throughout the past 1-2 months. I read that depressed people do not experience emotions but I am experiencing them but if I am left alone I go back to being anxious or upset. I have kept myself busy for the past one month by studying, YouTube, Reddit, anything... I do not want to see a Psychiatrist, nor do I want to talk to my parents about it. They both are MDs but I think they won't understand. I do not want to share my problems with them and put just another burden on them... Also, I think I can pinpoint the cause of this depression I just want to know if these were the symptoms anyone has experienced when they were depressed?";1
"I feel like I'm really close to the end of my rope. I can't remember the last time I've caught a break, it's just been shitty news followed by more shitty news. Things dont get better, but sometimes after a few days of wallowing I'll feel just a shred of tranquility in my life, just for it to get yanked out from under me. At this stage even the littlest things just throw me off the edge and I'll spiral back into all these dark thoughts. I just feel like I'm broken and I dont belong in this world. idk i just want this pain to end";1
"I’ve just noticed recently. I’ve got so much random stuff I’m stressed about my mind can wonder and stress out while I’m doing other stuff that normally kept my mind occupied. The most annoying is listening to music, and I don’t mean as background noise. Music used to be a good escape. Now I got a full blown rap coming out of my mouth as fast as it can move and simultaneously have my head stressing out in detail with what ifs about something I need to do tomorrow. Some of my work has a lot of numbers and data entry to it. I can be waist deep in numbers typing away and my mind is stressing out about something stupid in full detail again. I don’t even hold conversations while I’m doing my data work cause I know I’ll mess it up and I can’t focus on both but I can hold an entire conversation in my head and do it somehow. It’s so annoying I have no where to get peace now.";1

I’m just tired and stressed all the time and it’s in a cycle that just keeps going. I’m only in highschool and I already feel like my life is falling apart. I can’t seem to focus and I can’t seem to get anything done on time. I’ve lost all motivation to do school work. I used to love school and seeing my friends and now I’d rather fucking kill myself than deal with this anymore.

"Shits been rough. Looking back at the last 10 years all I can think is, why couldn't I just fucking chillllll I ran full speed into every bad decision, made every wrong choice. Every life lesson I've learned I learned the hard way.. and am still paying for all of it. I basically threw it all out the window. All the important things. Education, Family, Freedom. No education, betrayed family, I'm dependent on the government and kindness of a coworker to support my 2 little boys and myself, my job doesn't pay the rent to say the least, but I've got not qualifications, no ged or hs diploma. I guess my point is I'm so stressed and I need a break so badly. I'm tearing up writing this part, ugh. Anyway.. Im not religious but I beg god to give me a break dozens of times a day. But I don't think I deserve a break. I think I deserve to feel this pain and worry after hurting all the people who cared about me so much, and making bad life decisions leads to consequences.. now I'm living with my consequences and it's so horrible..I just want to scream and cry. But instead I go under the blanket like now, write down my thoughts and try to breathe it out and think of good things I can do to fix it.

"Hi I’m new here. I’ve battled with depression for maybe 15 years? Or more I don’t even know. The last year has been so much worse for me and it has nothing to do with Covid. I’m honestly sick of hearing about covid. My grandmother died a year ago and I feel like that’s when things made a turn for the worse. Her death was horrible. It wasn’t sudden but it wasn’t expected. Her health took a turn for the worse out of nowhere and she slowly died and I had to watch everyday for two months. It was traumatizing. My anxiety had become so unbearable I reached out to my asshole doctor for medication and got prescribed Prozac which I had used before and it helped. This time it helped but then I found it started making me incredibly angry and worse. So I went off and tried to just deal with it. Because there are good days where I do feel fine. But then it started happening again so I reached out to a psychotherapist. She helped me to acknowledge how shitty of a childhood I had so now more trauma has been brought up. I feel so overwhelmed with things in my life as well. Like working night shifts(which I should be getting off soon hopefully), a renovation to our only bathroom that started in April and still isn’t done.. body image issues like crazy. I have 1 friend but I try not to vent to her because I hate being so negative all the time. Friends are so hard to make for me. Anyway I have a lot going on. I made the call to my doctor again to try a different medication and cried to his receptionist. While my husband just stood there and didn’t comfort at all. He actually just left the room as I cried in a ball. Anyway I’ll wrap this up as I should probably go to sleep in prep for work. Ugh.";1
I am scared. I am falling into darkness. I am feeling unwell. I am happy in my life. But That's how people see me. But I am losing it. I laugh while I sleep. I cry when I wake. I crave death. There are so many methods. It all causes pain. But I can't feel them. I can't process emotions. What is pain? Sounds like something I know. I shall fall into the ocean. I will see darkness. I will panic. I will fight for my life. But eventually I shall get what I asked for. I will be free.;1
"To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week. First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable. All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad. I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this. Edit Thank you for the support everyone.

It was quite appreciated, so thought I'd do a little follow-up on how it's been going to recover and later also talk about how I lived that caused the burnout.

"Does anybody else get this feeling from stress like you're not in control of your own body in any way? Like you can't think critically, or sometimes at all. Your motions are like jelly, and even when you get control, you're super uncoordinated or a clumsy. In social situations, you feel more like a passenger for your own body who has no idea what to say or do but still has the capacity to be angry at yourself for not saying anything or doing something. It's like this self-awareness that stops short of allowing me to do anything. I have a lot of stressors in my life, and I can't help but think they've burnt me out so much so that I've become subject to these things. I've been told before to prioritize or to take on less things as a solution, but to me that's synonymous with settling on being capable of less than I thought I'm capable of. How do people function with high stress? How do you groom yourself to do that? I've lived like this for so many years and thought it would just come with experience, but now it just feel harder than its ever been";1

"Sorry for long post. 25M. The last month I have no clue what’s going on. It started with an internal hemorrhoid that seems to have gone now, but right after my bowel habits changed for the first time in my life. I’m not sure if I was constipated because I was still going in some fashion and it was soft. I also started to get back aches, especially in the lower back. My stomach was really bloated and my back was killing me as I was taking a cpa exam, I’ve wanted to go to the hospital several times but my parents talked me out of it. I took a laxative after my exam and that relieved the back pain and trouble, but since I’ve had an on and off burning sensation in my stomach, lower abdomen, and even thighs at time. The thighs have gone but it almost feels like there is a tight rubber band around my waist at times with an uncomfortable burning feeling. I do have anxiety troubles but I’m in CBT and things have been awesome. My GP said IBS but blew it off, and another GI guy just said Colonoscopy instantly. I saw one more person this week and he gave me some antispasmodics to try first before any colonoscopy. What’s weird is since I talked to him yesterday, the last day and a half, my symptoms have been just about nonexistent. Can’t be a coincidence can it? I haven’t even tried the medication yet and there’s been some burning tonight but not much, and I’m not even sure this is a Gastro issue. I’m trying to pass my last exam and just failed by one point and I take it again next week…could the pressure and stress of this exam be doing this to me?";1

"I came across my boyfriend in 2019 on bumble. Not sure what my profile looked like or his or what it said but I’m happy we matched. We went on a date and we were very similar however we were both busy and never set up a second date. Fast forward a year later, he requested me randomly on Instagram. Which we had never shared with each other. I messaged him and the next week we were on a date. It lasted like 8 hours and we just talked and talked and talked. It was amazing. Since then, we’ve been together, moved in, and are almost at a year! We are like the same person, and I could not be more grateful for him. It may sound silly but I think of the very tiny chance of meeting him on the app, or the tiny chance of coming across each other again and it makes me so much more grateful for him.

"Yes, I'm stuck in a job I hate and I don't have the option of leaving at all but I am my own worst enemy here. I constantly stress about the small things and its really affecting my capacity to perform. The days feel like years, and I'm always at the verge of breaking after one or two days. Please teach me methods to overcome this. I tried reframing my perspective but in the moment I still stress";1
"I’m not saying gun to my head thoughts. I mean like, driving down the road and once in a while my brain says “just turn into the opposite lane. It’ll look like an accident” but then I just shake it off. Or shaving my legs and think “just cut, bleed out, it’s so easy” but I never actually act on these things. They’ve just become a part of my life. I feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that I have to constantly argue with. It’s exhausting. ";1
"I've never really been hopeful for anything. And if I have been, it's never lasted for more than an hour. My expectations have always been at rock bottom to protect myself from disappointment. This has worked well for me, with minimal hurt from hoping too much. But. I don't need to do that anymore. I don't necessarily know why, but since June, I've been looking forward to waking up every morning. Actually, I know why. It's because the belief that I had to die to feel at peace has been proven wrong. Completely wrong. It's so reassuring to know it is possible to be happy and alive at the same time. For the past few years, I've been wallowing in my depression. I feared death but at the same time craved it. So, as foolish as I was. I tried. Failed. And regretted backing out for about 8 months. Mainly because I was now on people's watchlist. I had a fear of pills for a while. Just the thought of them made my stomach twist and turn. I would constantly lay in bed, stay up late to wake up minutes before the bus. I was convinced that there was nothing left for me. So I acted impulsively. If I was gonna go. I was going to go out with a bang. I fractured my hand. Had a scrap with my Bastard of a Parent. Attempted. Planned another. But at the same time, I desperately hung on. I didn't really want to die. No one really does. A close friend of mine dragged me out. I will always admire and appreciate her for having the patience to deal with me. She let me stay. And I've realized, her family is the polar opposite of mine. Calm and quiet majority of the times. Full of fun. Laughter. They don't raise hands or lace poison in their words. I didn't know that this was possible. For me to be happy for more than an hour. For me to be a part of a household where my contribution is appreciated and needed. Where my mental illness is not a myth. Where my feelings don't have to be locked away. I feel so validated and unconditionally loved. I want to start getting professional help. To better myself. I feel like with this. I can keep pushing forward. That I will keep standing up after falling down. No matter how many times that will be. I don't know why, but I feel happy to be here.";1

"A bit of background My sister struggles with mental illness to the extreme, we're talking cops at our door, constant trips to the hospital, alternate schooling and the whole lot. She needs 24/7 supervision and we have to have everything locked away out of her reach at all times. I currently live with both my mom and my sister and needless to say its very overwhelming dealing with her. Me and my mom have a hard time keeping it together and my mom will often turn on me due to stress, and since I have no outlet it makes going to work near impossible because I just sit and get angry about whats going on at home. Now suddenly our landlord turned around and sold the house, weve lived there for over 13+ years, been good tenants and always paid rent on time, he gave us no written notice and has made our life a living hell. Its all super illegal but thats a completely different story. We have 2 months to leave, our original plan was to get a 3bdrm and split it but due to high housing prices (we live in a big city) and landlords are ridiculous here, super scummy, they try to charge for many illegal things even asking hundreds of dollars just to fill out and submit an application. Even then its not a guarantee and half the places are bug infested and in the centre of crackhead central. Ive suggested to her that she finds a cheap 2 bedroom in the city for the time being with my sister. She needs to stay in the city or my sister loses all her support workers, schooling and the lot, its a 2 year waiting list minimum to get back in a program even if we provide transportation because the city will no longer cover it. I drive and work fulltime I can go where ever I want. My mother however doesnt drive and is currently laid off due to covid. I dont want to deal with them anymore, the constant violent out bursts, the screaming and crying, everyone at my work thinks im crazy because im always crying or throwing up from stress. I had to go on stress leave before this because the physical effects from stress was making it impossible and dangerous to work. The dizzyness and vomiting and the whole lot. Now when I suggested going our seperate ways to my mom I offered to help her in any way she would need including money and transportation to whatever extent I could spare, it ended with her screaming and crying that I was abandoning her. This makes me feel terrible but also makes me lean towards leaving even more. What route do I take? I know moneys already very tight for her and I love her but living like this day to day is literally killing me and I want to grow as a person and live my life. Tldr; my family struggles with mental health and I have the option to leave for my own sanity but it means abandoning them in their time of need.";1
I have a meeting with an admissions counselor in 2 days where I have to sell myself. Basically if I don’t get in here I will take a gap year or go to community college. My family and me and riding on this if it works out I’m just really worried anyone ever had a similar experience?;1
"I wrapping up my sophomore year of high school, and I have so many final projects to do, exams to study for, and just stuff in general to worry about. Problem is, I have so many things to do, and they all stress me out so much that I can't bring myself to do any of them. Every time I sit down to write an essay or whatnot, I just end up too emotionally tired to do it. I cannot open my laptop without feeling almost physically exhausted and ill. Does anyone have any ideas for combatting this, or any ways to push past it?";1

"I AM STUCK IN A HOUSE WITH TRUMP SUPPORTERS. I live in the Midwest, and I’m a senior in high school, and I can’t fucking wait to get the hell out of this suffocating place. And I can bite my tongue and handle my immediate family supporting Trump most of the time. But I just can’t fucking do it anymore. I just can’t. I broke tonight at the dinner table and slammed my hand on the table and yelled at my brother. I was talking, having a conversation about how I wasn’t comfortable going out to a restaurant because of COVID, and he rolled his eyes at me and said “Oh my God.” And I screamed “WHAT” back at him and put my dishes away and went upstairs. Now I’m in trouble for screaming. I fucking hate it here. I’m full of rage and anger and I can’t go for a drive because my car is broken right now. I needed to vent.

"/rant. after 10th std everything went downhill. grades, mental health.. this is my second attempt im so fkn scared. my parents' reaction to flunking my first attempt was insane. i got grounded and was yelled at for 4 months straight. since then ive no clue how the year went by but i just couldnt bring myself to sit and study and \*bam\* 13 days to exam. im a compulsive liar but ive no other choice. i had to constantly lie about preparation and marks. now im still shit 13 days is so not enough. students out there are preparing for two whole years for a decent score oh god i cant go through their emotional abuse again. im so screwed. i didnt want any of this. why'd i not start early.. it fkn hurts to see all those books and papers stacked in my bookshelf untouched reminding me of the potential and time gone wasted. im trying my best not to kill myself of guilt going through my middle school diary i seemed so perfect ..and happy. i was all hyped about medical field. now im simply lifeless. where'd it all go wrong why'd i bring this all upon myself";1

Edit 2 I'm in tears right now. I really didn't expect this kind of response and I'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed. I've been at the bottom of this hole for at least 4 years and things seem to be getting worse. Letting this out felt so good and I'm truly touched by everyone's comments.

"So I started off intending to pursue something else in college, I spent the past two years and had taken 32 credits geared to what I thought I originally wanted to do. Im Turing 21 in a couple of months and now just had a realization that no this is not what I want to pursue, so I applied to switch my major. Thankfully, the 32 credits can be applied towards the degree. However, Im turning 21 I feel like others around me have accomplished so much, and completing their degrees. Its just so overwhelming, and I feel like now my whole life timeline has been completely thrown off. Im back at square one with 4 years of college to go. I feel so stressed out.";1
"I’ve been on a bit of a downer recently but this has made me so happy! I spend a month every year in South Korea. Back in 2019, I planned a trip to the coast for just myself but decided to invite a friend of mine. She asked me if she could make it a big trip and bring 15 people I’d never met before. I said yes because I love meeting new people and I love the international community in SK. I booked 2 earlier extra days just for myself so I was there Thursday- Monday and she booked a 15 person house in the same airbnb right by my room for Sat-Monday. So I went and enjoyed two blissful days sat on the balcony and walking around the coast. On the saturday they all arrived, 2 different groups of friends my friend had got together to come down. We all had a wonderful time meeting each other, having bbqs, playing games, watching the sunset on the ocean etc Well today, I got a message on FB from a couple I met there. She was asking me to join their wedding via zoom and told me that they actually met on that trip. They wanted me, someone they’d only met for 2 days, to be at their wedding, because I was the one who had helped them meet! I am just so so so thrilled!!! I thought they already were together on that trip, I had no idea! I’m just super happy and can’t wait to witness their happy day.";0
I had resorted to self harming for a long time. Using knives were my poison. Right now I am struggling so much to not resort to it. I need help. Edit Wow. I didn’t expect this. Thank you everyone for all of these great tips and advice. And for those who are wondering I didn’t do anything and are still harm-free. I took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. I might be getting into kickboxing. Been getting that suggestion from the people in my life and it’s something physical with a healthier outlet. It’s still not easy but I now know that I’m not alone. Thank you Reddit.;1

I'm very reserved and don't like talking much however, no one in my family is like this. I've also got in a lot of trouble as well due to me trying to my own self and different. A lot of people outside have told me 'why am I so different?' Moreover, I been told off a lot about not trying to fit in the family. I always tell myself how I am a black sheep and bring a bad vibe to my family line and also have the tendency to bring bad things with me. A lot of times I say why I was picked instead of someone else. I've never done anything to make anyone genuinely proud of me as I'm such a waste.

"Hello my name is Pryscilla, I’m 20. I should be very happy. Just a quick run-down I go to college, I work, I have an amazing boyfriend, and I have friends. Lately keeping up with all this has gotten harder. Throughout my life it has been a series of crazy events and most of my life has been me going through depression even in my childhood years. I didn’t grow up in a healthy environment, I lost the person who helped raise me and who I saw everyday, am sleeping in his room, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship my high school to college years and now I should be happy. I was content before but I don’t know what happened. I talk to my boyfriend about it and I smoke weed all the time, I’ve grown addicted. I smoke to escape reality. I feel terrible. I feel like a terrible person and I get mood swings all the time. My boyfriend absolutely loves me and he urges me to get therapy and I want to. Especially because I want this relationship to work but most of all I just want to be happy for once. I am constantly negative and overthinking and I cry a lot, some days I feel like a different person. I want to seek therapy but I don’t have money, I’m broke. I’m not asking for anything but I don’t know where to go. I ask my mom to help me find therapy and she doesn’t take me seriously, even though years ago I had a suicide attempt and she dragged me to a therapist in which I denied help. But now I want it. What are the first steps to finding a good psychologist, how do I know what type to look for, how do I get a diagnosis, and does the fact that I have insurance help? Thank you.";1
"I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. I sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if I should write anything.

That sweet little guy saved me. Edit I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn’t expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management. To the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. It’s my experience, I can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn’t be real then.

Spending it yet again treating myself to gifts and food. Even if friends were there to celebrate it with me I just can’t keep up with the energy of pretending to be happy. I’m always stuck in my own world of depressing obsessive thoughts and need to be left alone. I don’t want to be left alone.;1

"I’ve had this debt for nearly 3 years now, and due to various financial situations it has been hard to clear it. Over the last 1.5 years though I have been slowly chipping away at it and steadily paying about £21 a month, it’s not much but my financial situation hasn’t been great. Today I have gone to pay my bill and discovered that I have actually paid half already. Plus my financial situation is only improving this year, and hopefully I will soon be able to pay it off completely. Which then means I can start using it responsibly to get my credit score back up, while I save and then be able to get a good rate for a mortgage in a few years time.";0
"Hi everyone, I have come to realise that my mind and body is defaulted towards being stressed. From the minute I open my eyes, to the minute I close them I am constantly ""doing"" things and feeling like I am a few steps behind. So for me it seems like an ingrained habit that I sort of deault to constantly. Does anyone have any ideas on how to break the habit of stressfully doing things and balancing it with just being? I do meditate, yoga and those kinds of things but even that can sometimes be a stressful ""must"". Any thoughts would be much appreciated!";1

I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?' When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. I don't really know why I'm writing this here. I guess I'm just sick of talking to myself. This somehow seems a little better. That might be another delusion... ";1
"I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out. Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health. I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite. Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me “just wait, your time will come” and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just “your life sucks, you can’t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better” Well what if it doesn’t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It’s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. Am I being a freak or what? Why can’t I just catch a fucking break? Edit you guys are really sweet and this made my day, thank you";1
"I swear to God, if I manage to kill myself and someone say some bullshit like ""If only she talked to us we'd have helped"" I'm coming back as a ghost to make their life a living hell. Keep your problem to yourself and your therapist because everyone else WILL use them to hurt you.";1
"Hey, I'm doing some videos where I share my burnout & fatigue syndrome journey. In my latest, I talk about how my life looked like prior to burning out. Shure, it got more intense the last six months before hitting the wall, but in reality, it started ten years earlier when I started studied to get a master's degree in engineering. In short. I kept myself busy ALL the time. I didn't particularly feel that stressed out, I know the 'bad' kind of stress which just cause a tremendous amount of anxiety, and that wasn't very present. But always being 'ON' and just putting in too many work hours per week without any real 'OFF' mood, I think is what eventually broke me. If you want to watch the video, it's here [";1

"The last time I cried before this was around 5 years ago when my dad passed away, this was when I was 14. This time the reason is also a sad one but not related too someone passing away. I think it was an accumulation of not feeling understood, stress for my exams and the realisation that even if I talk to my mother (the only living relative I still have/live with) she can't understand what I'm feeling/going through. We talked for so long and literally 5 minutes later it looks like she forgot all we talked about and continued minimising everthing I said and felt.

The situation is not likely to change in the next few months and I feel like I have already gotten so used to it.

Like everywhere you would read that stress = death and all the diseases caused/promoted by stress. Like yeah I feel pretty stressed out but overall it's still somehow bearable at the moment just because I've gotten so used to it. But what if in a couple years, when I'm finally ready to enjoy my life, I get diagnosed with cancer or some other disease because of the shit I went through? And yeah sometimes thinking about that stresses me out more than the actual stress I'm dealing with atm itself if that makes sense. Does anybody else feel like this?";1

I asked for help and you just said it was my hormones and teenager shit well it’s been over fucking 6 years so why the fuck am I still like this! I asked you to comfort me and be there for me and you just left me and said get over it. I asked if you would be sad if I died and you just laughed at me and said that’s FUNNY?!

"Just like the title says I am 58 M. I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to...... Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er. The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through. BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State. Have a good day. ";1

For the next 3 weeks, I've got a big important test each day. They're not even exams, just big tests. I told myself that I would start studying yesterday i came home, opened my agenda and started crying, it was big, ungly, loud sobs. I'm so stressed, I basically had a mental breakdown over school, and this isnt even the hardest year. One of the only ways I deal w stress is cutting myself, so that occupied me for a while. People always say put ur mental health before school work, but for me, a lazy perfectionist, that makes my mental health worse. I'm so tired because by the time I've finished crying about how much work I have, I'm completely drained and I fall asleep. I then wake up when my parents come home so 8PM, have dinner and then start my school work. I'm usually still up at 1-2 AM. Then I wake up at 7 and start again.

Now she's gone and I'm doing better cause I have some friends to talk to but that hasn't helped either. I find myself falling again, losing motivation again, feeling like ending it all again. I've contemplated suicide multiple times but I haven't taken the leap just yet. I don't know how much longer I can take this. It seems like I'm only ever happy when I do drugs but I don't have the money for that and I already recovered from an addiction once and I can't fall into one again. Idk why I'm typing this but last time I posted on a subreddit, typing out my feelings really helped.

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3 I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth. My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves. It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together. School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time. I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat. Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.";1
